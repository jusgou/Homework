ln -s hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php derive

./derive -g --mnemonic="twelve enforce skin bag choice alcohol club organ item rebel enlist idle" --cols=path, address, privkey,pubkey

-g (flag)=> GO or generate
--mnemonic => want to use your own mnemonic
--coin (parameter) => specific which coin (from the SLOP44 registry) to generate address for. for HWK and activities, we use either 'eth', 'btc', 'btc-test'
--cols (parameters) => specify which columns to output
--format (parameter) => we want the format to be JSON because JSON is key-value pairs and therefore easy to manipulate and access values
--numderive(parameter) => specify how many child address to use (can generate as many as you like)

using online tool vs using terminal vs using python
*why do we want to use CLI version instead of online tool - we don't want to use GUI and also we don't want to use another person's online application
* if we use terminal, we can actually use a python script to connect to the CLI version and streamline the process
* using CLI means that we have to have PHP installed (ours and on the computer that the script is running on (must be same version of PHP))
