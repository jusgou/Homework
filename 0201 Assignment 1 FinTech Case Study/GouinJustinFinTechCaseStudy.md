### FACTS TO INCLUDE:

Issued their first Green Bond in 2016. https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/copower-issues-first-green-bond-for-canadian-investors-567194981.html




$93 trillion in investment in infrastructure is needed over the next 15 years for the wolrd to limit the global average temperature rise to 2 degrees Celcius.

To participate in green investments usually requires that one be an accredited investor with substantial capital. 

Typical investors are unable to make green investments in a significant way, especially ones that are direct to project like the bonds are meant to offer: this excludes a substantial demographic that are interested in this kind of investing.

In a way, it has the potentail to draw people to the stock market who are generally alienated by entrenched beleifs about capital markets and capitalism in general. 

82% of Canadians are interested in socially responsible investments; 89% of green infrastructure projects are made by institutional investors. 

CoPower is an "exempt market dealer" (EMD), which allows them to issue securities to retail, non-accredited investors. 

As long as they comply with the precautions of the Ontario Securities Commission they can issue green bonds to the public. 

CoPower usually pools $10M per bond issue and then invested in Canadian and American project developers building renewable energy projects. 

The investments are secured by operational clean energy projects that are already earning stable revenues. 

"Whereas CoPower aims to invest in projects taht may not yet be fully mature (e.g. geothermal), but have a solid underlying technical and business model, SolarShare invests only in solar technology backed by long-term energy contracts. 

"CoPower and SolarShare feature two key innovations: filling a capital financing gap for small to mid-sized projects and opening up green investment opportunities to all investors. These two innovations go hand in hand." 

One of the limitations is that they do not have a secondary market. . . . 

"Based on several informal interviews with the CoPower team, the key barriers are ensuring an adequate pipeline of clean energy projects taht have the technology to potentially reduce a large amount of GHGs and produce stable revenues."

RBC defines CoPower as an online marketplace for investing in clean energy infrastructure

RBC IMPACT: CoPower's primry environmental impact is the amount of carbon offset by the projects they finance. Their platform further accelerates a reduction in greenhouse gases by helping new businesses succeed and by fostering the growth of a Canadian clean energy ecosystem.
Making it easy for Canadians to participate in clean energy investing.

Have they limited themselves by going to traditioanl banking with Vancity?

## Overview and Origin

* CoPower (founded 2013)
Founded by Raphael Bouskila (President) & David Berliner (CEO)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The founders wanted to capitalize on 3 trends: 

1: the shift to distributed clean energy generation and advances in energy efficiency and storage, which is reducing dependence on centralized, fossil-fuel burning utilities
2: the rise of online investing platforms, which is opening up new investment opportunities to various investor segments.
3: the growing demand for impact investments that intentionally generate positive social or environmental impact alongside financial returns.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Vancity's federally-chartered banking subsidiary, Vancity Community Investment Bank (VCIB) agreed to acquire CoPower in late 2019.

Venture funded (find that article where they secured $2 million); total funding amound $5.9M (Crunchbase; purchased in 2019 by VanCity and running as a subsidiary of VanCity. [There is some commission or fee from the bonds they sell as well I believe] "CoPower is a proud Certified B Corporation" (Crunchbase)

"Prior toe the acquisition, CoPower had raised more than 


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The company is responding demand for impact investing that allows investors to support projects that align with their ethical values. In the case of CoPower, these values pertain to Green technologies and projects that harmonize with environmental well being. [Although there are many Green indexes that allow consumers to invest in specific companies, Green Bonds are a relatively new phenomenon (why would people choose these over a green company or a green index)]. The benefit is that investors are able to fund projects that they can be certain will have an environmental impact. So rather than simply investing in a company that builds green technology, for example, they can invest in Green energy projects. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The consumer, most generally, is an environmentally conscious individual looking to earn interest income in projects that they can feel good about supporting. Specifically, it appears that the target demographic is the younger, millenial and Generation X consumer who is reaching an age at which they now have disposable income and equity.  These generataional demographics have a subset of individuals who are seeking innovative ways to use their wealth to support the future in which they believe. To invest in a bond that is unrated, and which is unprotected by the CDIC (Name) suggests a passionate individual with a different approach to risk management.
As of yet, I am not certain about specific numbers, but what is certain is that as the younger generations come into money, it is likely that this demographic will grow, and that this is a product that can be marketed to a broad base of consumers given the ethical cache that a project like this offers: there is a kind of idiosyncratic quality that stands in excess of the raw market value, a kind of social value, that supports this kind of product, and which suggests there is room for growth. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
At the moment, there are very few companies offering Green bonds, and so CoPower is innovating a new market space. Their unfair advantage is that they appear to be the first to enter this space and to provide product that caters to the unique needs of the abovementtioned demographic. 
Specifically: what technology are they using that gives them an advantage that their competitors might not have? 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

SolarSare is another Canadian company that offers Green Bonds, and that also attempts to connect clean energy projects to mainstream capital markets: both their projects endeavour to increase "the supply of clean energy in Canada, while allwoing investors of all types to invest in the projects" (https://static1.squarespace.com/static/598b47ff6a49631e85d75e53/t/5bf7041a4fa51a471a49377c/1542915099074/CoPower+%26+SolarShare_FINAL_EN_0_acc.pdf) 

SolarShare actually offers better returns on their bonds, and also offer an additional term, their 15-year Solar Bond. All of their offerings promise investors 5-6% returns compared to the 3-5% offered by CoPower.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Apparently they have managed to lend $12 million to date. . . 

Sold out. . . 

Raised money . . . 

Information on the VanCity acquisition: . . . 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Their metrics pertain to subscribership to their bonds primarily (get a bit more technical about the domain in general though, which is also subscribership in many cases, as it has to do with peole signing on to get their information from these companies that analyze and organize vast amounts of global data to generate investment opportuntiies (these are clearly using algorithms). . . 

The metrics are also to do with the classcial standards in this traditioanl domain: the ratings agencies: they know that they do not have the ratings and they have to anser this question on the website. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

There is a great deal of oporotunties for growht, but so far I have not seen any other examples of green bonds. . . [figure this out] 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
